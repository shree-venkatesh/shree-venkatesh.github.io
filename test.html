                The frontend of our ground control station, <span class="highlight">Houston</span>, is a React web app for monitoring and adjusting plane parameters during flight. 
                It tracks connectivity, telemetry (altitude, battery voltages, airspeed), and image data, allows in-flight camera adjustments, and facilitates mission parameter input and waypoint uploads.
                I designed and developed the UI for the Controls Page and the Report Page.
